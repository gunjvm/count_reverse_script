# Python function that:

- Accepts a string s as input.
- Prints the number of words in the provided sentence.
- Reverts the interior content of every second word in the string

# Explanation: 

- Splitting the string into words: The string is split into a list of words.
- Counting and printing the number of words: The number of words is counted and printed.
- Reversing the interior content of every second word: The loop iterates over every second word (starting with index 1). If the word has more than two characters, its interior content is reversed.
- Joining the modified words into a string: The list of words is joined back into a single string and printed.

# Example Output:
For the input string 
```

the function will output:
```

Modified sentence: This si a elpmas test ecnetnes for nohtyP code
